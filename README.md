Elemental Battles is a simple player vs. AI card game with an "elemental compatibility" component.
Backend logic is build on EOSIO blockchain smart contract.
Frontend is build on React/Redux.

Players will draw randomly from decks of 17 cards, identical for each player, and play successive rounds of cards against each other. Their hands are public, but the card that each player chooses in any given round is secret.
